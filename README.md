A collection of useful resources on communicating information effectively with *pizazz*

Feel free to download and use any poster templates/materials included here. I'd appreciate if you would include a link to this webpage in your work.

## Current trends:
### Material Design
1) https://material.io/ - Main page, good for all around information on standard practices and goals. Leads to all the following pages.
2) https://material-theme-builder.glitch.me/ - NEW! Build a full theme right in your browser. All-in-one solution to developing a Material Design theme for your work (Typography, Shape, and Color).
3) https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html - Decisions and insights on best color choices. Really good intro to the idea of working with colors in a functional manner (within the Material Design standard, but fairly applicable elsewhere).
4) https://material.io/tools/color/ - Color palette tool for quickly selecting an effective color palette. Jump to here for the fun stuff.
5) https://material.io/tools/icons/ - Icons for simple information. Save time and words and convey information through symbols.
6) https://material.io/tools/gallery/ - Gallery of Material Design themes. Useful as inspiration or a starting point in what you want to convey and how.

## Presentation Software:
###  PowerPoint:
1) https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-and-save-a-powerpoint-template-ee4429ad-2a74-4100-82f7-50f8169c8aca - Documentation on creating your own PowerPoint template. Useful way to keep your work consistent in the future.
2) https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-your-own-theme-in-powerpoint-83e68627-2c17-454a-9fd8-62deb81951a6 - Documentation on creating your own theme in PowerPoint. Save time in the long run, and spend extra time now in the design stage so you can reuse it in the future.
3) https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-merge-and-group-objects-on-a-slide-86f4be3b-0596-46d4-8200-1c9c308f5e3c - Documentation on grouping items in a slide. If you learn nothing else, please learn this.
4) https://support.office.com/en-us/article/guides-for-arranging-things-on-a-slide-in-powerpoint-33854dfa-e0d1-43ff-8971-667b19512de3?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US Documentation on aligning objects in a slide. If you learn nothing else, learn this. (Yes, this and grouping should be learned if you're going to rely on PowerPoint for your work)

## Plotting:
### Seaborn (Python library)
1) https://seaborn.pydata.org/ - Main page.
2) https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html - Great breakdown on color choices in plots, including shout outs to other great places that support functional and pleasing color choices. (I admit though, the default palettes used in Seaborn are typically too muted for my tastes)
3) https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html - Listed as a tutorial, but really it's a one-stop shop for "How can I plot X?" Importantly, the subsequent pages document when and why you would want to use some plots over others with your data.

Let me know if you come across any other great resources! joshua.e.zosky@gmail.com
